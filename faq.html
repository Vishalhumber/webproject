      <h2><a href="#">What if I incur overdraft or other fees as a result of the delay?</a></h2>
      <div>
        <p>
            we will not charge you any fees on your Bank account(s) as a result of these delays and we will
            reimburse you for any fees you may incur from other banks as a result of these delays. Our employees
            will work with you individual to resolve these outstanding issues. Please use a store locator to locate
            any of our branches nearest to you.
        </p>

      <h2><a href="#">Online Banking Services are down for maintenance for a short period of time during the weekends. Why is
        that?</a></h2>
      <div>
        <p>As part of our normal processing, Online Banking Services are unavailable for a short period during
            the weekends when transactions are updated. Knowing how important Online Banking is to our Customers,
            these updates are typically completed during the overnight hours to minimize the impact to our Online
            Banking users. The delays that we've experienced recently have required us to conduct system
            maintenance at other times of the day so that transaction updates can be made.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It's free.</li>
          <li>It lets you get more done in less time.</li>
          <li>It's cross-browser compatible.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2><a href="#">What is causing the delay at your call center?</a></h2>
      <div>
        <p>
            Many of our Customers have had questions about their accounts and have called our call center. This
            has led to unusual call volumes which have created longer than normal wait times. We have added
            additional staff, opened our stores earlier, and taken other steps to improve our ability to take our
            Customers' calls and questions
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2><a href ="#">What are the documents needed to open an account?</a></h2>
      <div>

      <ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">

      <li>1 proof of address document (if your photo ID doesnâ€™t have your current address)</li>
      <li>proof of legal status in Canada if you are not a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen</li> 
      </ul>
